This is a program that allows you to give a chatbot certain information about yourself such as your experience level, how many days of the week you would like to workout, and if you would like to workout at home or in the gym, and will give back a curated weight lifting program that fits your needs. I started off by describing a set of steps for the chatbot to follow, which is to greet the user, ask some certain questions, and finally output a workout plan, which can be modified before the program closes. Throughout the program, I put in certain rules that the AI must follow, which help the AI do the right things, and prevent it from getting off track. Following the set of steps, I have all of the allowed options for the questions asked. Then, I have all of the workouts for different body parts, categorized on if they were meant to be done at home or at the gym. Then, I gave the AI some more rules along with empty workout programs created for working out 1, 3, or 5 days a week, which the AI would fill out appropriately with the information collected from the user.
